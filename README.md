-=-=-=- PROJET PRESENTATION -=-=-=-

Autotask does not offer any dark theme for its interface.

So I made a request on this subject to the support of the publisher directly, who told me that it was not planned to put one in place. So, I first turned to the Autotask REDDIT community and told me that I could do one myself.

This is what I have since December 1, 2017. I created my own dark theme for Autotask. An overview of the result is available at the following link: https://imgur.com/a/MClXI

My project more and more pleasant to the greatest number and on the advice of a user (whom I thank besides still) I created a GITHUB on this project.

It can be shared more easily and also improve over time.

About me, I am primarily a system and network administrator.
I have some developing knowledge, but it's just a few things.

I hope this project will have a good life.

I thank in advance the different contributors and users of the theme.
